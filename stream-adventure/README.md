# stream-adventure

The stream-adventure [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io) is the oldest nodeschool
workshop, and it kind of shows, maybe? One of the challenges just plain does not 
work--even its reference solution. Some of the challenges are dead simple, while 
others are underexplained and obtuse. I appreciate the authors' great effort in 
creating this, but my brain doesn't work the same way theirs does, and at points
all this workshop did was make me think I'd be unlikely to voluntarily use Node,
Javascript, or its massive forest of loosey-goosey npm modules to solve a problem
of actual consequence.

I'd use [Go](https://golang.org).
