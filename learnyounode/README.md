## Notes

I once used [NodeJS](nodejs.com) professionally. Years passed, and both Node and
Javascript have changed. By quite a bit. I never stopped liking Node, although
my preference is definitely [Go](https://golang.org) if we're talking
preferences. This said, I attended a [NodeSchool
Seattle](https://nodeschool.io/seattle/) event, as an excuse to get out of the
house, meet some fellow nerds, and blow the dust off my Javascript and Node
skills. It was fun. I learned a bit, helped out fellow students, and made a few
new friends. My skills are still a little remedial and outdated, but this was an
interesting exercise in refreshing my memory and changing things up ever so
slightly.

I intend to do more NodeSchool workshops to bolster my knowledge, learn new and
interesting topics, and get a bit more up to speed on Node and Javascript.
